# Advancing-Healthcare-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

## **Objective**
The objective of this case study is to leverage Power BI for a deep dive into the provided healthcare datasets. This task encompasses meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated data modeling, utilizing DAX for advanced analytics. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard in Power BI that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data.
This analysis will provide invaluable insights, aiding healthcare providers in enhancing patient care and operational efficiency, and positioning HealthStat Solutions at the forefront of healthcare analytics.

## **Data Sources**

**[HealthcareDataset 1]:** Detailed patient information including Patient ID , name, age and other patient-specific data.

**[HealthcareDataset 2]:** Information about various Hospitals.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis is divided into two parts:

### **Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX in Power BI**

1. **Data Importing and Initial Examination**
    - Import both datasets into Power BI. Perform a preliminary examination of the data. Identify any data quality issues or inconsistencies.
2. **Merging and Relating Datasets**
    - Merge the datasets using a suitable column as a key. Ensure that the merge is accurate and retains all necessary information.
3. **Cleaning: Handling Missing and Irrelevant Data**
    - Identify and address missing data in both datasets. Address duplicate entries and irrelevant data points, ensuring data quality.
4. **Data Type Conversion**
    - Convert 'AdmissionDate' and 'DischargeDate' to the appropriate date formats. Calculate the length of stay for each patient.
5. **Categorizing Age Groups**
    - Create a new column categorizing patients into age groups (e.g., Child, Adult, Senior). What are the predominant age groups?
6. **Analysis of Treatment Costs**
    - Calculate the total cost of treatment for each patient (consider 'TotalBill' and 'DailyCost'). Which treatments are the most expensive on average?
7. **Gender Distribution in Diagnosis**
    - Analyze the distribution of genders across different diagnoses. Are there any noticeable patterns or trends?
8. **Blood Type Analysis**
    - Investigate the distribution of blood types among the patients. Is there a blood type that is more prevalent?
9. **Recovery Rating Analysis**
    - Using DAX, analyze the average recovery rating by treatment type. Which treatment type has the highest average recovery rating?
10. **Hospital Utilization Analysis**
    - Calculate the average number of patients per room in each hospital. Which hospital has the highest utilization?
11. **Doctor's Patient Load**
    - Analyze which doctor has treated the most patients. Does a higher patient load correlate with lower recovery ratings?
12. **Treatment Effectiveness**
    - Compare the length of stay against the recovery rating for different treatment types. Which treatment shows the most effectiveness?
   
### Part 2: Building an Excel Dashboard

dashboard includes interactive visualizations for showcasing key metrics like patient demographics, diagnosis distribution, treatment costs, and recovery ratings. Include filters for hospitals, diagnosis, and treatment type.
